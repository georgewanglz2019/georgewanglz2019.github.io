## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in **Data Science and Artificial Intelligence** at **Monash University**, with a research focus on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **Urban Transportation Analysis and Optimization**. My work lies at the intersection of **artificial intelligence** and **transportation engineering**, aiming to improve the efficiency and sustainability of transport systems.

Currently, I am also a **visiting PhD student** at the **KTH Royal Institute of Technology** (2025â€“2026).
